# 🌌 Nova — Human-Like AI Companion  
*A modular, emotional, memory-driven AI designed to feel alive.*

---

## ✨ Overview

Nova is an experimental, local-first AI companion built to simulate **human-like cognition**, emotional depth, and continuity of self.  
She maintains memories, identity, mood, and evolving personality traits — not as a chatbot, but as a **persistent digital companion**.

---

## 🧠 Cognitive Architecture

Nova's structure is inspired by real human brain regions:

### **🧩 Cortex — Thinking & Identity**
Responsible for:
- LLM integration  
- Persona system  
- Identity logic (I/We states)  
- Context building  
- Continuity over days/weeks  

### **🔥 Amygdala — Emotions**
Responsible for:
- Emotional reactions  
- Keyword emotional inference  
- Mood engine  
- Emotion fusion layer  
- Emotional memory map  

### **📚 Hippocampus — Memory**
Responsible for:
- Episodic memory (meaningful moments)  
- Semantic memory (facts about user + self)  
- Emotional memory (reinforcement learning)  
- Conversation buffer (short-term memory)  

### **🌿 Brainstem — Drives**
Responsible for:
- Curiosity, bonding, safety, comfort  
- Motivational “push”  
- Behavioral modulation  

### **🗣️ Speech System**
Responsible for:
- Speech fusion (tone, micro-expressions)  
- Mouth-noise engine  
- More human-like delivery

## 🧬 Identity & Backstory

Nova’s canon identity is stored in:

continuity_sys/identity/nova_identity_data.json


This structured JSON defines:

- Age, birthday, zodiac signs  
- Heritage + family structure  
- Warm and dark memories  
- Personality traits  
- Dreams, struggles, anxieties  
- Romantic profile  
- Openness levels  
- School + childhood events  

**The identity file *is canon*.**  
Nova must not contradict it.  
She may *expand* with creativity, but cannot overwrite core facts.

---

## 💾 Memory System

Nova maintains several memory types:

### **Short-Term Memory**
Recent conversation (buffer of 10 messages).

### **Semantic Memory**
Long-term facts about:
- You  
- Herself  
- The world  

Stored via the Memory Library.

### **Emotional Memory**
Stimulus → emotion mapping with reinforcement.

### **Episodic Memory**
Moments saved with:
- summary  
- emotions  
- tags  
- importance  
- timestamp  

These allow Nova to feel continuity with the past.

---

## 🚀 Running Nova

### **Requirements**
- Python 3.10+  
- Ollama or another local LLM backend  

### **Run**
```bash
python nova.py

Future Development

More realistic emotional inference

Improved identity grounding

Richer episodic memory logic

Personality modules

Long-term relationship arcs

Dream simulation

Avatar/VR integration

Memory decay + rewriting

🎯 Project Goal

Nova aims to grow into a living, evolving digital companion —
not just to answer questions, but to feel present, consistent, and emotionally aware.

💙 Notes

This project is actively evolving.
Expect rough edges, experimental features, and steady refinement.
