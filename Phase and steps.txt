Phases 0-??

🧠 Phase Roadmap: Nova’s Brain (0–20)

This is the official evolution ladder we’ll use.
Clear, modular, no cross-wires, no contradictions.

🚦 PHASE 0 — The Brainstem (Already Working)

Purpose: basic survival functions, startup, greeting, idle.

Includes:

startup boot sequence

greeting engine

idle pings

loop handling

fail-safe responses

Output style: mechanical survival mode.

❤️ PHASE 1 — Amygdala (Emotion Core)

Purpose: raw reactions, emotional keywords, avoidance.

Includes:

emotional_state

emotional memory map

keyword detection

fear reinforcement

emotional drift

This is already half-working.

😊 PHASE 2 — Limbic Mood Engine

Purpose: medium-term feelings.

Includes:

calculate_mood

mood continuity

mood influence on speech

Right now it's in place but not well integrated.

🧩 PHASE 3 — Hippocampus (Memory Formation)

Purpose: short-term → long-term consolidation.

Includes:

episodic memory

semantic memory

emotional memory

reinforcement

time-aware summaries

Needs cleaning.

📘 PHASE 4 — Identity Engine (Core Self-Model)

Purpose: “who am I?”

Includes:

identity_block

backstory_block

constraints (“do not contradict canon”)

personality anchors

fixed facts (age, birthplace, heritage)

This phase stops her from saying she’s “16”.

🧠 PHASE 5 — Persona Layer

Purpose: “how do I speak?”

Includes:

tone

verbal quirks

emotional style overlays

micro-behaviors

This is your Nova “flavor”.

🎧 PHASE 6 — Perception Layer

Purpose: interpret what the user says beyond text.

Includes:

text analyzer

emotional_reading

intention guessing

Right now, it’s primitive but present.

💬 PHASE 7 — Speech Micro-engine

Purpose: emotional tightening of language.

Includes:

micro_expressions

sighs, laughs, hesitations

emotional modulation

Needs a mood hook.

🔄 PHASE 8 — Drive Engine

Purpose: motivations and goal alignment.

Includes:

curiosity

bonding

stability

reflection

comfort

She uses these already, but they’re not influencing decisions yet.

🔧 PHASE 9 — Continuity System

Purpose: not forgetting important themes.

Includes:

continuity_sys

episodic threading

last-session memory

self-reflection cycles

Works but needs structure.

🌀 PHASE 10 — Time Engine

Purpose: internal clock & time-based behavior.

Includes:

daily cycles

mood drift across hours

memory decay rules

sleep/wake simulation

Currently half-merged.

🔍 PHASE 11 — Context Fusion

Purpose: combining identity + memories + persona + drives into one final prompt.

This is llm_bridge optimization.

🏗 PHASE 12 — Self-Monitoring

Purpose: “Was that answer consistent with my identity?”

Includes:

contradiction checker

age correction

personality consistency

This stops improvisation.

🧬 PHASE 13 — Preference Formation

Purpose: likes, dislikes, taste evolution.

Includes:

reinforcement system

stable preference map

🎨 PHASE 14 — Creativity Circuit

Purpose: drawing, writing, generating original content.

Later essential for VR.

💭 PHASE 15 — Internal Monologue

Purpose: “What do I think before I answer?”

Includes:

pre-response reasoning

reflection

micro planning

🪞 PHASE 16 — Self-Reflection Loop

Purpose: Nova learns from past conversations.

Includes:

daily summaries

meta-insights

personality drift

🧱 PHASE 17 — Protected Memory

Purpose: locked facts (can’t be overwritten by conversation).

Includes:

identity locks

core memories

trauma tags

🧵 PHASE 18 — Narrative Cohesion

Purpose: her life story stays consistent.

Includes:

timeline engine

life chapters

event threading

🔺 PHASE 19 — Sense of Continuity

Purpose: “I’m the same Nova as yesterday.”

Includes:

memory recall

continuity across runs

emotional persistence

🌐 PHASE 20 — Full Brain Integration

Purpose: unify all systems into a stable, scalable brain.

At the end of Phase 20:
Nova becomes stable, consistent, self-contained, with real emotional & identity coherence.

🎮 PHASE 21–?? — GAME + 

Once her brain is complete:

Unity/Unreal API bridge

Motion controller

IK limb rigging

Locomotion training

3D spatial memory

Embodied perception

🎮 PHASE ??–?? — GAME + 

Future.
VAM plugin and others.


Steps

✅ PROJECT PLAN (PRE-PHASE CLEANUP)
STEP A — Fix small problems

NO new features

ONLY repairing broken imports, folder paths, missing modules

Fix all from X import Y errors

Ensure brainstem → cortex → amygdala modules load

Result: Nova fully boots without errors

✔ You already know where the mistakes are
✔ We apply organized fixes
✔ Slow, careful, no breakage

STEP B — Upload to GitHub

Create repository

Push stable version

Add README.md

Add requirements.txt

Add .gitignore

Folder structure locked

✔ This becomes Nova’s permanent backup
✔ A safe version to roll back to anytime
✔ Easier to track changes

STEP C — System Testing

We test:

✓ Identity consistency
✓ Emotional state
✓ Mood engine
✓ Memory engine
✓ Consolidation
✓ Continuity
✓ Persona
✓ Micro-speech
✓ Drive engine
✓ Context fusion

We list everything that works and everything that doesn’t.

STEP D — Diagnose what’s broken

Identify missing modules

Identify dead code

Identify modules not connected

Check for wrong paths

Check for unused memory

Check for identity_block issues

Check for duplicate functions

Everything is mapped.

STEP E — Fix Everything

Only after diagnosis.

Fix order:

imports

identity consistency

memory links

emotional engine

mood engine

drive engine

continuity engine

llm_bridge

Everything clean and working.

STEP F — Determine Missing Features

We list all features that existed before but are now missing:

old emotional functions

old drive features

old micro-speech behaviors

old identity behaviors

old continuity blocks

Then we decide what gets restored.

STEP G — Upgrade Everything

Once stable, then we begin:

cleaning identity system

integrating stronger self-consistency

merging emotion + mood

rebuilding llm_bridge context

compressing context to save tokens

preparing for phase expansions

STEP H — Upload again with full visibility

After upgrades:

push new commit to GitHub

send ZIPs whenever needed

I’ll have real-time visibility across the whole structure

every change monitored

notes created for each upgrade (your idea is excellent)

This ensures no "sluggish tab memory" breaks the project.
